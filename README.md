# Machine Learning Exercise 1

This folder (`ML_one`) contains the materials and datasets for the first exercise in the **Getting Started with Machine Learning** series.

## 📊 Learning Machine Learning Fundamentals

In this exercise, we explore the basics of Machine Learning by working hands-on with essential Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The focus is on understanding data through cleaning, manipulation, and visualization techniques, which are critical steps before building any model.

This folder serves as a learning playground for experimenting with multiple real-world datasets and developing intuition about how Machine Learning algorithms interpret data.

## Contents

- **Ex-1.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook for Exercise 1  
- **ML-1.pdf**: Problem statement and theoretical background  
- **datasets/**: Folder containing CSV datasets used in the exercise  

## Datasets

The `datasets/` directory includes:

- `Iris.csv` – Iris flower classification dataset  
- `loan_train.csv` – Loan amount prediction dataset  
- `english.csv` – Metadata for handwritten character images  
- `diabetes.csv` – Diabetes prediction dataset  
- `email.csv` – Email spam detection dataset  

**Handwritten Characters Dataset**

## Notebook Summary (Ex-1.ipynb)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed on multiple datasets:

1. **Loan Amount Prediction**
   - Data inspection, missing value checks
   - Statistical summaries
   - Histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps

2. **Iris Dataset Analysis**
   - Species-wise distribution
   - Pairplots and correlation analysis

3. **Handwritten Character Recognition**
   - Label distribution
   - Sample image visualization

4. **Diabetes Prediction**
   - Feature exploration related to health metrics

5. **Email Spam Classification**
   - Initial analysis for spam vs non-spam detection

## Getting Started

1. Open `Ex-1.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / VS Code  
2. Install required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially
